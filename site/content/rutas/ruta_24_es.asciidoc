A school was founded here in 1276 by King James II of Majorca, following a request by Ramon Llull, where Arabic and other Eastern languages where taught to missionaries attempting to convert Northern African Muslims to Christianity. A few centuries later, Miramar became the Archdukeâ€™s favourite place to live and thus he commissioned the creation of a system of paths and lookout platforms.
